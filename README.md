## üî© Hardware Architecture:
Component	Specification / Pin Mapping 
- Microcontroller	Arduino Uno with Sensor Shield (for easy wiring)
- Motors	4x DC BO motors (geared), driven by L298N driver
- Ultrasonic Sensor	HC-SR04 (Trig=A5, Echo=A4)
- Servo Motor	SG90 (for scanning), Pin = 3
- Motor Control Pins	ENA=6, ENB=5, IN1=11, IN2=9, IN3=8, IN4=7
- Power Source	2x 18650 Li-ion 3C batteries (7.4V approx)
- LiDAR: RPLIDAR A1 with ROS 2 and RViz
- HC-05 bluetooth module

## üß† Working Logic :
#### Scanning & Sensing:
The ultrasonic sensor, mounted on a servo, rotates to scan the front-left, center, and front-right directions. It measures the distance to nearby objects in all three zones.

#### Decision-Making Algorithm:

Clear path ‚ûù Move forward.

Obstacle ahead ‚ûù Compare left/right distances.

Turn toward the clearer direction, bypass the obstacle, and return to the original path using timed 90¬∞ turns.

#### Motor Control & Speed Management:
Differential drive with speed compensation ensures smooth navigation. The L298N module takes PWM inputs for motor speed and direction.

#### Power Management:
Dual 18650 Li-ion batteries supply the circuit through the sensor shield, ensuring organized power distribution.
